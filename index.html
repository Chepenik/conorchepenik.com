                    Hi, I'm <span>Conor Chepenik.</span>
                    A Web Developer.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my website, which I created after delving deep into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Exploring the world of Bitcoin has exposed me to a wealth of knowledge in areas such as health, finance, and computer science. The ethos and principles of the Bitcoin community have led to the establishment of a more equitable and efficient system, driven by decentralization, verification, and permissionless access.

                    Bitcoin's revolutionary capabilities enable secure value transfer without the need for intermediaries, opening up new avenues for financial inclusion, particularly for those who have been excluded from the traditional financial system.
                    
                    With the advent of Nostr, I find myself more optimistic than ever about the future of humanity. While the world faces numerous challenges, technology has bestowed us with incredible abundance. Even some of the poorest individuals in the United States now enjoy luxuries that were beyond the reach of kings who lived centuries ago. This realization has motivated me to dedicate a significant portion of my time to developing tools that can benefit all of humanity.

                    <p>
                        I graduated during a pandemic and started working in tech sales shortly after. This taught me how to do cold outreach and deal with rejection. Something you can expect to receive from fiat maxis when you tell them their favorite currency is backed by nothing more than violence from the state.
                    <br/>
                    Jokes aside, I’m a big fan of learning about new technologies and helping educate others. I taught myself how to code to make this website and MassAdoption.net. Enjoyed the process so much that I decided to take a software engineering bootcamp which I'm currently enrolled in.  I also write Bitcoin articles to help educate anyone willing to listen. As they say the best way to learn something is by teaching. When I’m not busy doing these things you can find me running, reading, hanging around a comedy club or enjoying time with my daughter. I love meeting new people so feel free to shoot me a DM on Twitter or an email at chepenikconor@gmail.com

                               Most people have to learn this via an expensive lesson.
                               Luckily, if you hold your own keys there is no worries about contagion! 
                               Bitcoin held in self-custody has no counter party risk.

                                Real war between nation-states should be avoided at all costs though.
                                I personally think that Central Banks cause war with quantitative easing a.k.a money printing.

                            I've always had a dream of starting my own clothing company, and although I never registered an LLC, I discovered a way to create designs and print them onto clothing with the help of the internet. I'm inspired by Hal Finney's quote about using technology to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them. If you're interested in purchasing something with bitcoin, DM me on Twitter with your size, address, and full name and I'll send you a lightning QR code to place your order with a 21% discount. I plan on installing BTCpayserver in the future but in the meantime if you don't want to go through my Twitter DMs you can pay with fiat as well :P
