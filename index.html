    <h2>Thanks For Checking Out My Website</h2>
    <p>A little more about me. I'm a proud father. Some of my favorite books include Atlas Shrugged, The Bitcoin Standard, and The Mandibles. I used Udemy to teach myself how to make this website. I played football for 11 years of my life. At the moment Twitter is my favorite social media platform but that could change if I find a better one. I just think a lot of Bitcoin Maxis are on Twitter and I've found Bitcoin maxis to be some intelligent people!</p>
